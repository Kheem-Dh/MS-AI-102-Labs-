    "\n",
    "# Introduction\n",
    "A prevalent design for modern \"intelligent\" applications is to facilitate users in posing questions using natural language and obtaining pertinent answers. This approach essentially brings conversational intelligence into a standard FAQ system. In this module, we will explore the utilization of Azure AI Language service for constructing a repository of questions and corresponding answers to aid an application or chatbot.\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end of this module, you will:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Understand the question answering capabilities of the Azure AI Language service.\n",
    "- Differentiate between question answering and conversational language understanding.\n",
    "- Know how to set up a knowledge base.\n",
    "- Understand the concept of multi-turn conversation.\n",
    "- Learn to test, publish, and consume a knowledge base.\n",
    "- Delve into the concept of active learning.\n",
    "- Discover the process of creating a question answering bot.\n",
    "\n",
    "# Understand Question Answering\n",
    "Azure AI Language service introduces a question answering feature, enabling you to establish a knowledge base of question-answer pairs that can be consulted using natural language inquiries. This knowledge base can be made accessible through a REST endpoint, making it ideal for client applications, primarily chatbots.\n",
    "\n",
    "A conversational app, at its core, utilizes a repository of questions and answers.\n",
    "\n",
    "The knowledge base can be derived from various existing sources:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Websites showcasing FAQ sections.\n",
    "- Documents containing structured content like brochures or manuals.\n",
    "- Built-in chit-chat pairs that mirror common conversational interactions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "# Compare Question Answering to Azure AI Language Understanding\n",
    "A question answering knowledge base is essentially a language model. This raises the question: when should you utilize question answering versus the conversational language understanding feature of the Azure AI Language service?\n",
    "\n",
    "Despite both features enabling natural language queries, their primary use-cases differ. Let's break it down:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Feature | Question Answering\t| Language Understanding |\n",
    "|:--------:|:--------:|:--------:|\n",
    "| Usage Pattern |\tUser poses a question for an answer |\tUser delivers an utterance expecting a response or action |\n",
    "| Query Processing |\tService matches question to a knowledge base answer |\tService interprets the utterance to align with an intent and detect entities |\n",
    "| Response |\tStatic answer to a recognized question |\tIndicates the likely intent and associated entities |\n",
    "| Client Logic |\tClient typically displays the answer |\tClient acts based on the detected intent |"
